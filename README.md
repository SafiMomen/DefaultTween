Blend is a UI framework inspired by Fusion.

TO-DO:
- Start tween from interrupted position. [BUG] [DONE]
- Use default values if not given time, easying style, and easing direction. [BUG]
- Accept time, easying style, easing direction as observables. [FEATURE]
- Accept reverse and repeat count. [FEATURE]
